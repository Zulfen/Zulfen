# Welcome to my profile! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [Zeardle](https://github.com/orgs/zeardle/repositories), a clone of the popular Heardle game, written using Kotlin, Spring Boot and React.
  - [ZulfEngine](https://github.com/Zulfen/ZulfEnginePlusPlus), a 3D game engine to be written in C++
- ✔️ Notable projects that are mostly completed:
  - [ZulfBungee](https://github.com/Zulfen/ZulfBungee), an addon to a popular Minecraft server-side scripting language which adds inter-server communication (useful for multi-server setups). Currently has over 6,000 downloads on [skUnity](https://forums.skunity.com/resources/zulfbungee.1474/). The plugin is due for a re-write at some point due to the stuff I learnt while making it.

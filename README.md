# Welcome to my profile! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [ZulfChat](https://github.com/Zulfen/ZulfChat), a simple Android chat app built against modern standards (Jetpack Compose, single activity etc..)
  - [ZulfEngine](https://github.com/Zulfen/ZulfEnginePlusPlus), a 3D game engine to be written in C++
- ✔️ Notable projects that are mostly completed:
  - [ZulfBungee](https://github.com/Zulfen/ZulfBungee), an addon to a popular Minecraft server-side scripting language which adds inter-server communication (useful for multi-server setups). Currently has over 6,000 downloads on skUnity. The plugin is due for a re-write at some point due to the stuff I learnt while making it.
